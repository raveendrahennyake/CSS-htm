@Entity Annotation
This annotation, part of the javax. persistence package, is used at the class level and marks the class as a persistent entity. It signals to the JPA provider that the class should be treated as a table in the database.

@Table Annotation
@Table Annotation. The @Table annotation provides the specifics of the corresponding database table. This includes the name of the table, the catalog, and the schema. If no @Table annotation is provided, the default table name will be the name of the class.


@Autowired 
What is the @Autowired Annotation? @Autowired is one of the core annotations in Spring, used for automatic dependency injection. In simpler terms, it allows Spring to automatically wire the required beans (dependencies) into your classes, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

@Controller annotation
We can annotate classic controllers with the @Controller annotation. This is simply a specialization of the @Component class, which allows us to auto-detect implementation classes through the classpath scanning. We typically use @Controller in combination with a @RequestMapping annotation for request handling methods
